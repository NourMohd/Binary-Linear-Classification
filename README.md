# Binary-Linear-Classification
Given the MAGIC gamma telescope dataset. This dataset is generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. The dataset consists of two classes: gammas (signal) and hadrons (background). There are 12332 gamma events and 6688 hadron events.

Applied different classification models such as Logistic Regression and KNearest Neighbor (K-NN).
